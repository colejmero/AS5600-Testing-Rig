# AS5600-Testing-Rig

To see instructions on 3D printing and assembly of the structure please open the pdf (AS5600 Sensor Test Rig.pdf) which has images of the full assembly CAD as well as the assembly in real life. 

This repository holds the SolidWorks files for the CAD model, which can only be opened by SolidWorks. They were created using SolidWorks 2019. 

It also houses the .STL versions of these files for 3D printing. Use this with your prefered slicer and 3D printer.
